## Algebra

### Fields

1. made a modified definition for groups that applied to non zero numbers of a field over multiplication.
2. Using this definition and existing group definition, I defined fields.

### Finitely Generated Groups

1. Created the file on finitely generated groups, with a function proving that an element is finitely generated.
Have to further work on it once primes have been defined with the appropriate properties.

## Number Theory

### Primes

1. IsPrime and IsComposite types are the types of proofs that a number is prime or composite respectively.
2. Showed that two is a prime to verify the functioning of the IsPrime type.
3. Proved that a number cannot be both prime and composite using a helper function (a not equal to na, where n is greater than 1).
4. genFact generates a list of factors of a number along with the proof that they are factors.

## Utility files
1. Created a file on lists to extract useful results from the genFact function mentioned earlier.

### Pending (for now)
1. To show that any number greater than 2 is either prime or Composite.
2. To show that every divisor of a number is contained within the genFact list.
