## Algebra :

Added the definitions of :- 
  1) An Intergal Domains
  2) An Euclidean Norm over an Integral Domain
  3) An Euclidean Domain

## Number Theory :

  1) Provided a partial proof of Euclid's Division Lemma (Existence of Quotient and Remainders when we divide a natural number by another),      which was later improved upon by other people. (This also had 5 auxiliary proofs, which include Trichotomy of the order on integers        and Anti-symmetry of LTE)
  2) Provided the definitions of a Common Factor Type and a GCD Type. (I did not prove that such a GCD would be unique)
  3) Proved the following facts about the GCD (This had about 4 auxiliary proofs): (Which was also later improved upon by other people)
     1) If d is a GCD of a and b, then d is also a GCD of a + b and b.
     2) If d is a GCD of a + b and b, then d is also a GCD of a and b.
     3) If d is a GCD of a and b, then d is also a GCD of b and a.
